## Hey, I'm Raul.

I build data/ML projects, web apps, blockchain & cryptography systems, and occasionally play with Swift.

I care about solid architecture, readable code, and not shipping fragile systems.  
Most of what’s here is small tools, experiments, and prototypes around privacy, security, and getting ideas into production.
